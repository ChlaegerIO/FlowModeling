# FlowModeling
The target is to model a weather video, which is a complex nonlinear systems, through sparse identification of the most important modes of a dataset using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and later the SINDy algorithm.

In the folder `Chapter-DMD_book` is the extended code examples of the book: _Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems (Author(s): J. Nathan Kutz , Steven L. Brunton , Bingni W. Brunton and Joshua L. Proctor, https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611974508)_

In the folder `My_Models` is the code used to get the results for my Model

In the folder `Videos` is a link to a video collection and some database files which are too large for my GitHub lfs storage capacity. 


Notes on git:
Discard commits by moving the head to the origin/main (in online repository) with `git reset HEAD~5` where 5 means 5 steps back.
