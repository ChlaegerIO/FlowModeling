# FlowModeling
The target is to model complex nonlinear systems through sparse identification of the most important modes of a dataset using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD).

In the folder `Chapter-DMD_book` is the extended code examples of the book: _Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems (Author(s): J. Nathan Kutz , Steven L. Brunton , Bingni W. Brunton and Joshua L. Proctor, https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611974508)_
